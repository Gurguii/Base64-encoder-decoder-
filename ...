# [C++] - Base64 encoder/decoder 
b64C++20.cpp => requires -std=c++20 option when compiling since it uses std::span to parse args.  
b64.cpp (reccomended) => doesn't use <span> header and does the same

## Description  
Program that allows base64 encoding and decoding text/file.  
## Setup  
Clone de project  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gurguii/Base64-encoder-decoder-
```  
Get into the project directory  
```bash
cd Base64-encoder-decoder-
```  
Compile  
```bash
g++ -std=C++20 <desiredfile.cpp> -o <executable_name>
```  
Note: If you're using b64.cpp as your input file, you don't need to add '-std=C++20' when compiling but you can leave it. If your input file is b64C++.cpp then you need to add it.  
## Encoding

```bash
./base <file|string>
```  
## Decoding
```bash  
./base -d <file|string>
```  
or 
```bash
./base <file|string> -d  
```  

## Output
Encoded/decoded data will be printed so in order to save output to file just redirect it:  
***./base "hello worldÂ¡" > [filename]***
